## Individual Component Assessments

### ROS Node (`rospinn.py`)
**Current State**: Implements the main control algorithms using PINN and RL.
- **What's Left**:
  - Optimize the ROS node for better performance.
  - Ensure robust error handling and logging.

### FPGA Configuration (`fpga` Directory)
**Current State**: Contains FPGA-related files, likely including `uart_comm.v`.
- **What's Left**:
  - Verify the FPGA configuration and ensure it is correctly programmed.
  - Optimize the Verilog code for efficient communication.

### Main Script (`main.py`)
**Current State**: Automates the compilation of the Verilog module and the execution of the ROS node.
- **What's Left**:
  - Ensure the script covers all necessary setup steps and handles errors gracefully.

### Motherboard Design (`mortymb.py`)
**Current State**: Defines electronic components and connections using `skidl`.
- **What's Left**:
  - Verify the design for correctness and completeness.
  - Ensure the generated netlist and PCB layout are error-free.
