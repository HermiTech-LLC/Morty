# Personal Completeness Assessment

## Overview

The current state of the Bipedal Humanoid Control System project demonstrates a solid foundation in combining advanced neural network algorithms with real-time robotic control. However, the following areas require attention to achieve personal completeness:

1. **Library Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all required KiCad library files are correctly installed and referenced in `mortymb.py`.

2. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Verify the proper configuration of the FPGA and UART communication to fully leverage hardware acceleration.

3. **Performance Tuning**:
   - Continuously optimize the ROS node and neural network models to enhance real-time performance and stability.

4. **Model Accuracy**:
   - Further refine the PINN and RL models to achieve precise and reliable control strategies.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Implement rigorous testing protocols to validate the system's functionality and robustness in various scenarios.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain detailed and up-to-date documentation to facilitate ongoing development and troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

By addressing these areas, the project can move closer to a state of completeness, ensuring a robust and efficient bipedal humanoid control system.
